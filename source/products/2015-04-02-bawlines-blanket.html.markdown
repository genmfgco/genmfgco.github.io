The Bawlines Blanket consists of two Japanese brushed cotton twills—one side is grey, the other dark blue—quilted together with a thin batting on a 75-year-old quilting machine. The blanket is finished with a heavy cotton blanket stitch and a subtly embroidered [GENMFGCO](http://www.genmfg.co/) eclipse mark.
